The game is called "Frog Jump" and the objective is to keep the frog from falling into the water by jumping from one stone to another. The game is controlled by the player using the keyboard.

At the start of the game, the frog appears falling randomly, and stones are randomly generated on the water surface. The player can make the frog jump by pressing the space key. Once the frog lands on a stone, it can jump again by pressing the 'j' key. The player must time their jumps carefully to avoid falling into the water.

To make the game more interesting, flies occasionally appear on the screen, and when the frog catches them, it gains an extra life. The player can see their current life count at the top of the screen. If the frog falls into the water, the player loses a life. The game ends when the player runs out of lives.

The game features background music and sound effects for jumping, catching flies, and falling into the water. The graphics are simple and colorful, with an animated frog and stones on a blue water background.

Overall, "Frog Jump" is a fun and challenging game that tests the player's timing and reflexes. It's a great example of what can be achieved with the Pygame library in Python.
